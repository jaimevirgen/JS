# Lesson 00
Introduction

### About the Author
I am a Front-End software developer primarily focused on JavaScript development.
I have worked with a variety of frameworks and libraries over the years, from jQuery
to Enyo to Backbone to Angular to Polymer to React, etc.

Over my tenure in software development I have had many
individuals express interest in understanding the lingua-franca of web, JavaScript.
These are the individuals I want to focus these lessons towards to.

While frameworks and libraries have very opinionated ideas about syntax and code
organization, the similarities between them far outweigh their differences. This middle-ground
can sometimes be referred to as "Vanilla Javascript" that's where these lessons attempt to focus on.

### About the Lessons
Each lesson is meant to be an open-ended problem, with much of the contextual structure in place
it is meant to be a half-started code base setup to complete the "Prime Directive" of the lesson.

Each lesson has "Required Readings" meant to convey the principles necessary to understand 
the purpose of each lesson. These by no means will touch on everything needed to complete certain tasks
as the voluminous depth of the JavaScript language can be analyzed to no end, but more indicative
of the habit of many successful software developers, constant learning.

The JavaScript web landscape is notorious for its fast-paced development, frameworks, workflows, and
even language syntax itself are constantly being updated by the JS community, for a JS developer
their main task is to stay current, and that requires a significant amount of time reading and learning.
