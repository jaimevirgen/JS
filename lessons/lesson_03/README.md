Data Structures - Arrays

### Prime Directive
A simple re-ordering algorithm logic should be implemented
in the empty function reOrder that willl re-render the number
list in a correct order. Work with arrays and familiarize yourself
with its data structure methods to manipulate arrays.

### Secondary Directive
Attach an event listener that will add a new integer to the original number list,
after which it will update the displayed list in the correct order.
