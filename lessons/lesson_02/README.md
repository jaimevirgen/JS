### Prime Directive
Modify the function that executes when an item is added to the list,
so that the list displays all "available" todo items.
Make use of browser's Storage object available through the Window object,
to add items with the form to the Todo List.
Todo list should display items even after refreshing, saved in user's browser data.

### Secondary Directive
For extra credit add button to each item in the todo list
that when clicked deletes the item from the list permanently.
